Task 7: System Resource Monitoring with Netdata

🎯 Objective

This task focuses on deploying and utilizing Netdata, a real-time performance monitoring tool, to observe and analyze key system and application metrics. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how system resources are consumed in real time, using a lightweight and interactive dashboard.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Netdata (Open-source, real-time monitoring solution)

Docker (Containerization platform)

Local Machine (For hosting and accessing the dashboard)

🚀 Installation & Configuration

Deploy Netdata using Docker:

docker run -d \
  --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata

Access the Netdata Dashboard:
Launch your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:19999

📈 Metrics Tracked

CPU Usage: Utilization across cores and processes

Memory Consumption: RAM usage and cache metrics

Disk I/O: Read/write speeds and access patterns

Network Traffic: Inbound/outbound bandwidth

Docker Containers: Resource usage of individual containers

Alerts: Threshold-based system notifications

Logs: System logs available at /var/log/netdata

🧠 Key Concepts


Collectors

Modules that gather and stream metrics from system sources.

Dashboard

Interactive web interface displaying real-time metrics.

Performance KPIs

Key indicators such as load average, latency, I/O wait, etc.

Alerting System

Real-time, rule-based notifications for performance thresholds.

💡 Summary & Insights

Netdata provides a powerful and efficient method to monitor system health in real time. Its visual and interactive interface, combined with its ease of deployment via Docker, makes it ideal for developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals. Compared to more complex platforms like Prometheus, Netdata offers instant insights with minimal setup, suitable for quick diagnostics and performance tuning.
